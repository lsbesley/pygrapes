# PyGRAPES
PyGRAPES (**Py**torch **gra**zing incidence **p**tychographic **e**ngine for **s**urfaces and nanostructures) is a versatile pytorch-based multislice framework for 3D reconstruction and simulation of ptychographic data in grazing incidence.

PyGRAPES is best suited for grazing incidence and reflection geometry ptychographic datasets, supports multiple incidence angles, and multiple rotational angles about the surface normal, allowing users to specify complex imaging geometries and perform iterative reconstructions from ptychographic datasets.

PyGRAPES is tested on GPU and is strongly reccomended to run on GPU, but should run on CPU. 

## Installation
You can either clone the repository, or run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lsbesley/pygrapes.git
